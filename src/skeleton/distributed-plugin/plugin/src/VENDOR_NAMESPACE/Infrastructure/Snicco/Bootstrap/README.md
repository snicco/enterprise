# The Bootstrap directory

This directory hosts all of your `Snicco\Component\Kernel\Bootstrapper` classes.

A bootstrapper can serve one of two purposes:

1. Bind services that Snicco needs to resolve for you:
2. Configure service definitions in the container that are created in a third-party bundle.
